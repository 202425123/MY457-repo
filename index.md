# MY457 Causal Inference for Observational and Experimental Studies
  
### Winter Term 2024
  
[Main course repo](https://github.com/LSE-MY457/lse-my457.github.io)

[Moodle page](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1111)

### Instructors

Office hour slots to be booked via LSE's StudentHub

* Course convenor and lecturer: [Dr. Daniel de Kadt](mailto:d.n.de-kadt@lse.ac.uk), Department of Methodology.
* Seminar leader: [Dr. Michael Ganslmeier](mailto:m.g.ganslmeier@lse.ac.uk), Department of Methodology.
* GTA (no office hours): [Pedro Torres-Lopez](mailto:p.torres-lopez@lse.ac.uk), Department of Social Policy. 

### Textbooks

Throughout the term we will dip into three main resources: 

* Angrist and Pischke, _Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion_, 2009, Princeton University Press. 
* Imbens and Rubin, _Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences_, 2015, Cambridge University Press. 
* Huntington-Klein, _The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality_, 2022, CRC Press. 

### Formative problem sets

These will be released every two weeks at 5pm, after seminar. You must submit one week later at 5pm, on **Moodle**. Your submission should be written in **RMarkdown**, and must be a **knitted .pdf**, formatted as shown in this [problem set template](psets/template/pset_template.Rmd). If you do not follow the formatting requirements your problem set will not be marked. Comments will be returned via Moodle within two weeks of submission.

### Detailed course schedule

*Please note, links to slides and code will be updated/added in advance of each week's teaching.*

#### 1. Potential Outcomes

This week begins with an introduction to the class, both substantively and administratively. 

We then introduce the potential outcomes framework, which will provide the technical foundations that are used throughout the rest of the class. We will also briefly introduce the graphical approach to causal inference.

#### 2. Randomization

This week we will introduce the concept of randomization and its value for causal inference. We will discuss, at a high level, design, analysis, and inference in randomized experiments.
